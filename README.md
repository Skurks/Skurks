# Skurks Leadership README/Operating Manual
I aspire to be the best stand up, hard-working, ever-learning technology executive who won't shy away from rolling up the sleves and getting my hands dirty when needed, or working on problems no one else wants to solve. Building great (and profitable) products and experiences are not done in a vaccum or via brilliant ideas from HPPO, but in becoming a student of your customers'/market's pains and aspirations.

## My Leadership Philosphy
* Try to live by [Principles of Marine Core Leadership](https://www.mcjrotc.marines.mil/About/Leadership-Principles/)
* Show [intellectual curiosity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2017/03/06/what-happens-when-leaders-lack-curiosity/#3cd906236b74)/effort before asking for help 
* Proactive sharing (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Pay it forward

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Mornings; before Noon
Thinking (No Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
1x1 Days | Thursday & Friday
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Fridays; After 2PM

## My Communication Channels
*  My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be a hyper efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to 'think'. 
* I'm a morning person so can send communications at ridiculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (with conditions)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'll likely decline.
* I do my best to not ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.

Mediums

Hit me up in whatever medium you'd like (I have all of my notifications on silent). I strive for a 24-hr SLA. If it's crazy urgent, don't hesitate to come find me face to face or double-ring me on the phone.

## My expectations of folks who report to me
