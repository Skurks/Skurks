# Skurks Operating Manual
I lead with heart and hustle. Market obsession fuels delightful products, built by teams I coach to do the same.

## My Leadership Philosphy
* I try to live by [Principles of Marine Core Leadership](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Fidelity-%20Leadership%20Principles.pdf)
* Show [intellectual curiosity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2017/03/06/what-happens-when-leaders-lack-curiosity/#3cd906236b74)/effort before asking for help 
* Proactive sharing is essential (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Pay it forward

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | V Early Mornings; but really anytime before Noon
Thinking & Doing (No Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
1x1 & Team Days | Thursday & Friday
Worst Day/Time for an intense meeting | Fridays; Any day after 2PM

## My Communication Channels
* My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be a hyper efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to think. 
* I'm a morning person so I've been known to send communications at ridiculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a quick response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (an agenda is required...see next)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'll decline.
* I do my best to NOT ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.
