## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Mornings; before Noon
Thinking (No Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
1x1 Days | Thursday & Friday
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Fridays; After 2PM

## My Communication Channels
*  My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be a hyper efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to 'think'. 
* I'm a morning person so can send communications at rediculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (with conditions)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'll likely decline.
* I do my best to not ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.

CHANNEL (Most urgent to least urgent) | BEST FOR
----- | -----
Phone Call | Collaboration, time-sensitive/urgent (< 24 hrs) question/request
SMS | Logistics, semi-urgent question, check-ins, shooting the "shit"
Email | Async specific request, transfer of knowledge
Slack | Non-urgent, general comms

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please setup a healthly system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I HATE surprises.
