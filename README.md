# Skurks Operating Manual
I lead with heart and hustle. Market obsession fuels delightful products, built by teams I coach to do the same.

## My Leadership Philosphy
* I try to live by [Principles of Marine Core Leadership](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Fidelity-%20Leadership%20Principles.pdf)
* Show [intellectual curiosity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2017/03/06/what-happens-when-leaders-lack-curiosity/#3cd906236b74)/effort before asking for help 
* Proactive sharing is essential (managing up/across)
* Outcomes > how
* Pay it forward

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | V Early Mornings; but really anytime before Noon
Thinking|Doing (No Meeting Days) | Tuesday & Wednesday
1x1 & Team Days | Thursday & Friday
Worst Day/Time for an intense meeting | Fridays; Any day after 2PM

## My Communication Channels
* My time (and thus my calendar) is very important to me. I strive to be a hyper efficient person & purposefully carve out time in my day/week to think. 
* I'm a morning person so I've been known to send communications at ridiculous hours of the morning. I don't expect a quick response.
* Please DON'T double book me. My calendar is public and open. If the calendar slot is open, take it (an agenda is required...see next)!
* Please DO share an agenda & any background reading/context with the invite. If there's no agenda, I'll decline.
* I do my best to NOT ping/message folks over the weekend unless they've reached out first.

Hit me up in whatever medium you'd like (but I do have ALL my notifications on silent). I strive for a 24-hr SLA. If it's crazy urgent, double-ring me on the phone and you'll get a call back within 5 mins.

## My expectations of folks who report to me
* Please setup a healthly system of push/pull of sharing information (over-communicate). I can always handle bad news, but I HATE surprises.
* Please take ownership of you career and personal/professional development. If I have to be pushing you often, we won't last long.
* Please tell me if anything feels off, as soon as you feel it.
* I work weekends occasionally, this is my choice. I do NOT expect you to work weekends, but I do expect you to crank during the week. 

## What you can expect of me as your manager
* Someone who will fight with and for you to acheive outsized professional growth & development
* Someone who won't micro-manage you, but expects much of you
* Someone who cares less about facetime/hrs worked as much as the quality & impact of your output
* Someone who over-indexes on transparency. Sure, there will be some things I just can't share with you, but I will NEVER lie to you. 

## My energy creators
* Fixing/helping/problem-solving
* Telling stories with data
* Lifelong learner (aspiring [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath))
* Mentorship (bi-directional)

## My achilles heels (but actively working on em)
* Short on patience at times. Call me out in the moment if you see pursed lips
* Heart on my sleeve. Call me out in the moment if I seem too intense
* Long winded at times. Just inturrupt me when I start to monologe
